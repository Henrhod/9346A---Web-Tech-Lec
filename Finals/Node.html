				<p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, 
						non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. <br>It’s an asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime, which is designed to build 
						scalable network applications.It can handle many concurrent connections at a time, where when connection request are made concurrently for each connection 
						a callback is fired .If there is no task to be performed Node will go to sleep.</p>
				</div>
				<button class="accordion">How Does It Work?</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>The main idea of Node.js: use non-blocking, event-driven I/O to remain lightweight and efficient in the face of data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. 
						Node.js operates on a single-thread, using non-blocking I/O calls, allowing it to support tens of thousands of concurrent connections. npm is a Node.js package 
						of open source library which is one of the largest libraries. </p>

				<div class="panel">
					<p>Node.js is a server-side programming framework, built on Chrome's JavaScript engine, this makes possible
					event-driven and non-blocking I/O. node.js is that it has an asynchronous way of execution wherein it is very appropriate in execution of task at the same time
					. It is suitable for applications where connections should be kept connected. </p>
